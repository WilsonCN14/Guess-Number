# Guess-Number
Java game where the computer picks a number from 1 to 100 and the player has 5 attempts to guess it.

Future Additions:
- GUI (Swift?) instead of command-line interface
- Replay game when win/lose
- Print out error message when player enters something other than a number 1 through 100
